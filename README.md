## 📌 Insights from the Dashboard

### 📈 Macro Trends (2015–2018)
- There was consistent growth in avocado demand from **2015 to 2017** across most regions and sizes.  
- In **2018**, demand declined significantly both at the **national level (US total)** and across individual regions.  

### 🗺️ Regional Demand (2018)
The following regions were among the **top 10 for highest demand**:
- West  
- South Central  
- California  

### 🥑 Conventional vs Organic Demand
- Conventional avocados had **significantly higher demand** than organic avocados.  
- Organic demand remained **consistently low** in comparison.  
- Although conventional demand declined in 2018, it was still higher than organic demand.  

### 💲 Price vs Demand Relationship
- There is a **negative correlation** between price and demand.  
- As avocado prices increase, demand decreases.  
- The highest demand occurs when prices are approximately **$0.50 – $1.50**.  
- Higher prices reduce demand, but the effect becomes less steep at the highest price ranges.  
- A **non-linear (exponential) trendline** was used instead of a linear one to better represent this relationship.

## 💡 Recommendations
- 📣 Increase marketing and promotion of **organic avocados** to boost their currently low demand.  
- 💰 Focus pricing strategies within the **high-demand price range ($0.50–$1.50)** to maximise sales volume.  
- 🗺️ Prioritise inventory and distribution in **high-performing regions** such as the West, South Central, and California.  
- 📉 Investigate the cause of the **2018 demand decline** to prevent future drops.
